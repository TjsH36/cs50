0.  Longest word in english. 45 characters. It is the invented long word, which means a lung disease.
1.  This is used to get the resource usage measures and statistics. It can used to get these measures either for the calling process, childern or calling thread.
2.  Total 16 members are there in struct rusage.
3.  The struct rusage has values which need to be maintained throught the course of the program, like ru_stime,etc. It will be difficult to pass on these values thorough functions. So, we send only the pointer to this.
4.  The main for loops functions as follows:
        Initially, it reads single character at a time. Checks the for loop exit condition: !=EOF and enters.
        Then the character is checked if it is indeed a alphabet or an apostrophe. If true, it is appended into word string.
        If the word string exceeds the length, i.e, if a bigger word is inputted, it is discarded and a new word is taken.
        Similarly, all numericals are discarded.
        After taking the word, it is checked for mispelling. Time taken is noted down.
        Then all the mispelled words are printed one by one.
5.  Completely relying on fscanf is risky, as we may end up reading very big words, whose lengths are greater than 45. We might alse be reading integer values.
6.  These are constant pointers, which mean they can only point to one thing. It cannot be changed. To remain same, without any change, through-out the program, they have been made constant.
