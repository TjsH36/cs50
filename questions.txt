1.  It is a header which declares fixed and specified widths for integer types.
2.  These are part of stdint.h header. These are used to fix the exact length for a particluar integer. uint8_t fixes exactly 8 bits, similarly, unit16_t fixes 16 bits, uint32_t fixes 32 bits.
3.  BYTE : unsigned 8-bit; DWORD : unsigned 32 bit; LONG : 32-bit signed integer, in twos-complement format; WORD : 16-bit unsigned integer
4.  A WORD type to store bfType.
5.  bfSize: Store the size of bitmap file in bytes. bSize: The size of structure (BITMAPINFOHEADER) in bytes.
6.  If biHeight is negative, then it implies that it is a top-down DIB and its origin is upper-left corner.
7.  The number of bits-per-pixel is given by biBitCount
8.  Returns NULL if there is'nt any such file.
9.  Because, it takes only one element(one colour blue/green/red) at a time.
10. 3* 3(size of rgbtuple)= 9; 9%4=1; 4-1 = 3; 3%4 =3. Final value of padding is 3
11. To seek for certain length from a given position. It moves the seek pointer to a certain place from a certain place.
12. SEEK_CUR implies current position of the file pointer.
